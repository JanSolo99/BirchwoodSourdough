 Of course. Here is a summary of our session:

  Goal: To fix a broken bread preorder form, make it secure, and prepare it for free web hosting.

  1. Initial Problem:
   * Your order form in birchwood-sourdough-replica1.html was not working.
   * The error log (log.txt) showed a ReferenceError: dailyStock is not defined, which meant the JavaScript code was trying to use a variable that didn't exist.

  2. The Journey to a Solution:
   * First Fix (Incorrect): We initially tried a simple client-side fix, but you correctly pointed out this wouldn't track stock globally and would expose your
     Airtable API key, creating a security risk.
   * Second Fix (Better, but Incompatible): We then built a Node.js Express server (server.js) to hide the API key and handle requests. However, we realized this
     wouldn't work with your goal of hosting on a free static site service like GitHub Pages, which cannot run a server.
   * Final Solution (Secure & Deployable): We re-architected the project to use serverless functions, the modern and correct approach for this situation.

  3. Current Status & What We Did:
  We have now completed all the coding. The project is secure, functional, and ready for deployment.

   * Backend Logic: We created two serverless functions in the netlify/functions directory:
       * get-stock.js: Securely fetches the current number of available loaves from Airtable.
       * create-order.js: Securely validates that stock is available and submits a new order to Airtable.
   * Frontend Update: We modified birchwood-sourdough-replica1.html to communicate with these new, secure serverless functions instead of directly with Airtable.
   * Project Configuration:
       * netlify.toml: A configuration file that tells a hosting service like Netlify how to deploy your site and functions.
       * package.json: Defines the airtable library needed by our serverless functions.
       * .gitignore: A file that ensures you don't upload unnecessary files (like node_modules) or old files (server.js) to your GitHub repository.

  Your Next Steps:
  When you restart, you are ready to deploy the site.

   1. Upload to GitHub: Create a new GitHub repository and upload the project files. I have provided the list of which files to include and which to ignore (thanks to
      the .gitignore file).
   2. Deploy on Netlify:
       * Create a free Netlify account and connect it to your new GitHub repository.
       * In the Netlify settings, add your AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_BASE_ID as environment variables.
       * Click "Deploy". Netlify will automatically build and host your site, along with the serverless functions.

  Your preorder app will then be live, secure, and functional for your customers.
